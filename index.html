<p>hi guys i just want to say that i am learning the basics of html from scratch
Here we are using index.html because serves as a home page for a website
</p>
<video width="670" height="1010" autoplay muted <source src="video1.mp4" type="video1/mp4"> ></video>
<!--the control tag adds video controls like with play,pause and volume-->
<!-- It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads. -->
<!--The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from.  -->
<!-- auto play is used to play the video automatically -->
